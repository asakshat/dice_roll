# Dice Roll Game 🎲
## A small project exercise from a course from Udemy. 🧑‍🎓

### 🎮 Game Rules :- 

 1. Player 1 starts first. 
 2. Player can roll the dice as much as they prefer. However , rolling dice with the side of 🎲 loses their turn and the current score.
 3. Holding after rolling the dice adds the current score to the total score and switches turn to the other player.
 4.  Any player with `score >= 100` wins the round.
